**Research:**  My research interests focus on integrated circuit design, particularly in machine learning accelerators and hardware/software co-design. Next-generation computing hardware must deliver the remarkable capabilities of large AI models while maintaining energy efficiency. Thus, my current development goal is to create a domain-specific computing system to scale up productive and effective neural networks. Motivated by this vision, I have built a solid foundation through my research experience in related fields and the extensive skills acquired from graduate-level courses.

**Education:**  I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Electrical Engineering from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), previously known as National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), where I worked with [Prof. Hung-Ming Chen](https://vdalab.web.nycu.edu.tw/advisor/) and [Prof. Juinn-Dar Huang](https://sites.google.com/view/adarlab/professor?authuser=0). I was a research intern at [Academia Sinica](https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en), where I worked on efficient learning algorithms for biomedical signal processing with [Dr. Yu Tsao](https://homepage.citi.sinica.edu.tw/pages/yu.tsao/contact_en.html).
