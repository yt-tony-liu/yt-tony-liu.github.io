**Research:**  My research interests focus on integrated circuit design, particularly in machine learning accelerators and hardware/software co-design. Next-generation computing hardware must deliver the remarkable capabilities of large AI models while maintaining energy efficiency. Thus, my current development goal is to create a domain-specific computing system to scale up productive and effective neural networks. Motivated by this vision, I have built a solid foundation through my research experience in related fields and the extensive skills acquired from graduate-level courses.

**Education:**  I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Electrical Engineering from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), previously known as National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), where I worked with Prof. Hung-Ming Chen and Prof. Juinn-Dar Huang. I was a research intern at Academia Sinica, where I worked on efficient learning algorithms for biomedical signal processing with Dr. Yu Tsao.
